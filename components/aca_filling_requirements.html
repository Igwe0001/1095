                    <p>Employers with 50 or more full-time employees (including FTEs – Full-time Equivalent Employees)
                        and all self-insured
                        employers regardless of size must report their health care coverage information to their
                        employees and the IRS.
                        Applicable Large Employers (ALE) (those that employ 50 or more full-time employees) are required
                        to report under section
                        6056.</p>
                    <p>A full-time employee generally includes any employee who was employed on average for at least 30
                        hours of service per
                        week for more than 120 days in a year. It is interesting to note that using these guidelines,
                        you may have less than 50
                        full-time employees, but you may meet the requirements for ACA reporting. For example, if you
                        had three employees – who
                        each worked for 120 days one after the other for at least 30 hours per week, they will be
                        counted as three FTEs instead
                        of as one employee. We suggest that you use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/shop-calculators-fte/">Full-time Equivalent Calculator</a>
                        provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">Healthcare.gov</a> to help
                        determine your filing obligations.</p>
                    <p>Further information about ALE- Applicable Large Employer and Employer Shared Responsibility is
                        provided by the IRS and
                        can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/employers/questions-and-answers-on-employer-shared-responsibility-provisions-under-the-affordable-care-act">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>If you are an insurance company or business that is required to report health care coverage, you
                        will need to file one
                        of the two form types with the IRS.</p>

                    <p>Under IRC Section 6056, starting in January 2015, large employers (those with 50 or more
                        full-time employees, including
                        FTEs) are required to provide Form 1095-C (employee statement) to each of their employees and
                        send a 1094-C
                        (transmittal) to the IRS. Form 1095-C and the transmittal 1094-C require specific information on
                        the employees’ (and
                        their dependents’, if applicable) insurance coverage. The forms include data such as Tax Id (TIN
                        or EIN), address,
                        full-time status, length of employees’ full-time status, proof of minimum essential coverage
                        offered, coverage dates,
                        and employee’s share of coverage premium costs.</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">Form 1095-B, and 1094-B</h2>
                    <p>Under IRC Section 6055, starting in January 2015, insurance companies (self-insured employers)
                        are required to provide
                        Form 1095-B to the individuals covered and to send Form 1094-B (transmittal) to the IRS. Form
                        1095-B and the transmittal
                        1094-B need specific information on the employees (and their dependents’, if applicable)
                        insurance coverage. The forms
                        include data such as Tax Id (TIN or EIN), address, and period of coverage.</p>
                    <p>For further information about section 6055 reporting requirements see the <a href="">instructions
                            for Forms
                            1095-B and 1094-B</a>.</p>
                    <p>Forms 1095-C and 1095-B can be filed on paper or electronically with the IRS. However, businesses
                        having more than 250
                        forms, must e-file with the IRS.</p>
                    <p>Currently, there are no state reporting requirements associated with the 195-C and 1095-B.</p>
                    <p>For employers and employees who do not comply with the ACA reporting requirements, penalties will
                        be imposed.</p>
