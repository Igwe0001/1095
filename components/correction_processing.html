                <section class="mb-5">
                    <p>If you made a mistake on a 1095 form that has already been filed, you would need to file a 1095
                        correction. Many service
                        providers do not offer correction filing or charge extra for filing corrections. Filing
                        corrections can be complicated
                        and may result in IRS penalties if done incorrectly.</p>
                    <p>We offer a robust solution for 1095 correction processing. We not only file corrected forms with
                        the IRS but also
                        provide corrected forms to employees.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3">Correcting Errors on form 1095-B and 1095-C</h5>
                    <p>The correction process depends on the error in the original form. If you have used the wrong codes on the original form,
                    you will need to file forms with the correct codes. IRS has various business rules that must be followed, our system
                    checks for these errors before filing, thus eliminating the possibilities of these errors.</p>
                    <p>The most common errors are the incorrect Employees’ or their dependents’ TIN. We strongly recommend that you use our Tin
                    matching service to make sure you are filing correct SSNs. If you do not have correct SSNs for dependents, it is
                    permissible to use the date of births.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3">Correcting Errors on Form 1094-C</h5>
                    <p>If there are errors on forms 1095-B or 1095-C when we file correction forms, we also file forms 1094-B or 1094-C. There
                    are instances when there are errors on form 1094-C only, without any errors on form 1095-C. Our system is equipped with
                    filing corrections just for form 1094-C.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3">When to file corrected forms</h5>
                    <p>The corrected form should be filed as soon as the error is discovered. In general, corrections to 1095 forms should be
                    filed for returns filed within the last three calendar years.
