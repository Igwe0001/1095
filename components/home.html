                    <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires applicable large employers (those having at least 50 full-time employees) to file
                    information returns regarding the health insurance coverage that they offered with the Internal Revenue Service and to
                    provide statements about their health insurance coverage to their full-time employees. These information returns are
                    used to monitor compliance with the ACA. Due to their crucial role in the administration of the ACA, these new reporting
                    obligations tend to be complex and require considerable attention. Not complying with the new reporting standards will
                    result in penalties and an increased risk of audit. For these reasons, it is vital to go to a third-party filing service
                    to help simplify the process of ACA reporting.</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">How the 1095/1094 filing works</h2>
                    <p>AWe are offering a complete outsourcing solution for 1095-C and 1095-B reporting. For the last seven years, we have been
                    a leading source for 1099 and other Information Return Forms. Now, we offer the same simplicity and the lowest price in
                    the industry for the Affordable Care Act Information Reporting. Our services include the printing and mailing of form
                    1095-C and 1095-B and e-filing with the IRS using their new AIR filing system.
                    
                    With our 1095 and 1094 reporting services, you do not have to worry about purchasing software or annual renewals. We
                    help businesses focus on their core competency while we take care of their information reporting.
                    
                    Our service model offers two distinct services. With our web-based self-service model, businesses with a small number of
                    forms enter or upload their information online using our easy-to-use website, while we take care of the printing,
                    mailing, and e-filing from our end. With our outsourcing model, we do all the work. We upload your data into our system,
                    we validate all formatting or business rules errors, and then we print, mail, and e-file the 1095-C and 1095-B forms. If
                    you have a large number of forms (250 or more forms), we ask you that you get this process started as early as possible
                    to make sure you have a date reserved for mailing out your forms.</p>
