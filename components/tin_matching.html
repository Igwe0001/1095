                <section class="mb-5">
                    <p>It is important for you to make sure that you are reporting correct Tax ID/name combinations to the IRS when submitting
                    1095 forms. To prevent IRS penalties for incorrect reporting and to reduce the cost associated with issuing B-Notices,
                    we highly recommended that you verify the accuracy of the employees’ Tax IDs.</p>
                    <p>One of the primary reason for rejection of for 1095 forms is the wrong SSN for an employee or their dependents. When the
                    IRS rejects a 1095-B/C form, you are required to file a correction form, which could be time-consuming and expensive. We
                    highly recommended that you use our TIN matching service before filing your 1095 forms, to make sure you are submitting
                    correct information and that your forms will not be rejected.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold">How it works</h5>
                    <p>Our TIN matching service works seamlessly with our e-filing system. Just choose the option for TIN Matching when
                    submitting your forms. If you have selected the TIN matching service, then our system will automatically send out the
                    TIN matching request before e-filing your forms. If the TIN match result detects a discrepancy, we inform you so that
                    you can verify the information with your recipient and correct the information. We resend your information to verify. If
                    it is a match, we e-file your forms.</p>

                    <p>3 = TIN and Name combination do not match IRS records.</p>
                    <p>4 = Invalid TIN Matching request (i.e., contains letters or special characters).</p>
                    <p>5 = Duplicate TIN Matching request.</p>
