                    <p class="lead mb-3">E-Delivery of 1095-C and 1095-B forms</p>
                    <p>E-Delivery instead of mailing paper copies is rapidly becoming very popular for providing 1098,
                        1099, and W-2 copies to
                        recipients. E-delivery is also going to be popular among employers to be able to furnish to each
                        employee. Usually,
                        companies print and mail copies to their employees. This is a very time consuming process, as
                        they have to print, stuff,
                        seal, apply postage to, and mail copies. You can avoid all these costs by using our e-Delivery
                        method for providing
                        recipient copies.

                    <p>It is important for you to make sure that you are reporting correct Tax ID/name combinations to
                        the IRS when submitting
                        1099 forms. To prevent the IRS from levying penalties for incorrect reporting and to reduce the
                        cost associated with
                        issuing B-Notices and withholding federal taxes from form 1099 payments, it is highly
                        recommended that you verify the
                        accuracy of the recipients’ Tax IDs.
