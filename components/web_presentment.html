                <section class="mb-5">
                    <p>E-Delivery instead of mailing paper copies is rapidly becoming very popular for providing 1095-C
                        or 1095-B copies to
                        employees. E-delivery is also going to be popular among employers to be able to furnish to each
                        employee. Usually,
                        companies print and mail copies to their employees. Mailing out paper copies is a very
                        time-consuming process, as they
                        have to print, stuff, seal, apply postage, and mail copies. You can avoid all these costs by
                        using our e-Delivery method
                        for providing recipient copies.</p>
                    <p>You have to provide your employees’ emails, and we take care of the rest. We provide for your
                        recipients a secure
                        website in which they can access and print their forms. If your recipients do not accept
                        e-delivery, then we mail out
                        paper copies.</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">How it works</h2>
                    <p>You need to provide us the email addresses of your employees while submitting your forms. Once
                        the forms are ready, we
                        inform your employees automatically that they can access their forms online. Your recipients can
                        log onto our website,
                        <a href="https://www.eFile360.com" target="_blank">www.eFile360.com</a>, using their email and
                        the last four digits of their tax id. They have
                        the option of using
                        e-delivery. If your recipients accept e-delivery, they can access, print, or save their forms.
                        However, if for some
                        reason they do not accept e-delivery, or if they do not even open their email, we wait for three
                        days and then print and
                        mail their statements. If the deadline is approaching and we do not have three days to hold on,
                        then we mail out paper
                        copies immediately. Our e-delivery is 100 percent compatible with IRS guidelines for all tax
                        purposes and allows your
                        employees to print as many copies as they need.
