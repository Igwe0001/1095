                    <p>Once you sign up with us, we provide instructions to load your 1095 data securely to our web
                        server. We provide
                        specially designed Excel files that you can use to save your data. Once we receive your data
                        files, we load the data
                        into our system and perform basic data quality checks. We provide a checklist for you to make
                        sure the data we have
                        imported matches your records. Once you approve, we print and mail the completed forms. Click <a

                    <h5 class="fw-bold">No software to purchase or install</h5>
                    You do not have to buy or install any software. We take care of everything from importing data to
                    printing and mailing.
                    We also make sure that we meet all filing deadlines. Our 1095 outsourcing services adhere to the
                    latest IRS filing
                    regulations covering all supported form types.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bold">PDF copies of 1095 forms</h5>
                    To provide filers (you) their copies, we use PDF copies of 1095 forms. Our design team creates these
                    reports so that we
                    can deliver your forms to you securely and electronically. PDF is a commonly used document format,
                    and all computers are
                    capable of handling PDF files.</p>

                    <a href="/pages/web_presentment.html"><b>E-Delivery</b></a>
                    <p>If you choose, we can make your employees’ forms available online instead of printing and
                        mailing. The <a href="/pages/web_presentment.html">e-Delivery</a> of
                        1095 forms, also referred to as Web Presentment is an efficient way to furnish recipient copies
                        and stay compliant with
                        IRS regulations. Our Service Bureau will notify your recipients once the forms are available
                        online. If your recipients
                        do not opt for electronic delivery, we print and mail their statements. You can find out more
                        about e-Delivery or Web

                    <h5 class="fw-bold">USPS Mail Tracking</h5>
                    We send our mail pieces using Intelligent Mail Barcodes, which the USPS uses to track the movement
                    of mail pieces before
                    they are delivered. This gives you access to the status of mail delivery. This is just another way
                    to keep you informed
                    at each step of the process. Please note that USPS tracking is not available for certain forms.
